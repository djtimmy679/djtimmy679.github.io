         <!-- <p>Starting with my first job as a lifeguard during high school, my journey has taken me to explore my interests and passions. 
            My love for chemistry led me to the US Naval Research Lab (NRL) in the summer of 2019, where I worked on Raman and Infrared spectroscopy. 
            Here, I was able to see how my work could impact soldiers and sailors on the ground.
            Following this, I was accepted into Cornell University's College of Engineering on a full-tuition Army ROTC scholarship.
            However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought unexpected challenges. Despite this, I was able to continue my research at NRL remotely, where I was able to learn how to code and still contribute to the mission.
            Also during this time, I was also able to work an internship at Modus Create Inc, where I explored web development and cloud computing. 
            

            These experiences led me to major in Computer Science at Cornell. 
            I interned at the Department of Defense, where I again saw my work have tangible contributions to our servicemembers. 
            Following this, I spent two summers working at Microsoft, where I worked on cloud projects within the defense space.. 
            Alongside my academic and professional p, I was a member of Cornell Army ROTC's Excelsior Batallion and served as VP of Finance for Beta Theta Pi. 

            I hope this page offers a more detailed glimpse into my journey beyond what a resume can convey. Please feel free to reach out with any opportunities or inquiries.
