            AWS Acme Instant Tunnel is a tool to temporarily grant SSH access
            via Port 22 for a preconfigured EC2 instance to an authorized &
            authenticated user. The following services were used to build this
            tool: Serverless framework (serverless.com), AWS Lambda w/ Node.js,
            DynamoDB, EC2 & Security Groups, SAML & SSO Authentication via Auth0
            (Google G-Suite, Github), API Gateway, S3 Static Front-End Site
            Hosting.
          </p>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The CIS security best practices for AWS (4.1) recommends
            that Port 22 has no public incoming traffic (0.0.0.0/0), so a
            problem arises when trying to access instances via SSH. A possible
            solution to this would be manually adding permissions (access from a
            specified IP address for example) to a instance's security group,
            but this could be very error prone and inconsistent. Some
            enterprises deal with this issue by having people VPN into their
            corporate network and having people SSH from there. However, this
            doesn't make sense for many distributed organizations where there is
            no VPN or granting access to a VPN is not a good idea for those who
            need to SSH into AWS resources. 
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2> 
          <p>
            AWS Acme Instant Tunnel presents an
            alternative to the two aforementioned approaches by automating the
            authorization, management and storage of security group permissions
            for temporary SSH access.
